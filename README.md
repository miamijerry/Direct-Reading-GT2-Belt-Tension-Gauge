# Direct-Reading-GT2-Belt-Tension-Gauge
A method to accurately determine GT2 belt tension

![Math Formula](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46931420-2bd3-4c01-8f57-04409e5adf24)

Per the 1/64 deflection per inch of belt method

I created three STL's for V2; Front Pins, Sled, and Deflection Knob. These mount a Force Gauge

To set the amount of belt deflection, I am using a #10-32 threaded rod attached to the Deflection Knob

Each 1/2 turn of a #10-32 screw equals 1/64 of an inch.

The first beta version was not accurate, and it was determined that the friction of the belt against the pins was creating incorrect reading.

The first working version (V1) assembly used GT2 idler pulleys for the pins. The results have been within 0.2 pounds.

I am not releasing V1, because V2 was much better.

Thanks to DIYshift, who's tension gauge was used to model the Front stl.

DIYshift tension guideline; 
# Voron - A/B 6mm Belts Min 2.0 lbs Max 3.5 lbs, Voron belted Z 9mm belt min 4.5 lbs Max 6.0 lbs


# Verifying that this gauge is reading correctly

Hang a known weight from a section of GT2 belt

Following operating procedure

Verify that the gauge reports the same value as the known weight
