# New V2 being tested!!!

A method to accurately determine GT2 belt tension

![Math Formula](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46931420-2bd3-4c01-8f57-04409e5adf24)

Per the 1/64 deflection per inch of belt method

I created three STL's for V2; Front Pins, Sled, and Deflection Knob. These mount a Force Gauge

To set the amount of belt deflection, I am using a #10-32 threaded rod attached to the Deflection Knob

Each 1/2 turn of a #10-32 screw equals 1/64 of an inch.

The first beta version was not accurate, and it was determined that the friction of the belt against the pins was creating incorrect reading.

The first working version (V1) assembly used GT2 idler pulleys for the pins. The results have been within 0.2 pounds.

I am not releasing V1, V2 coming soon

Thanks to DIYshift, who's tension gauge was used to model the Front stl.

Recommended GT2 Belt Tension

Hard to find this information, 

From https://www.sdp-si.com/D265/PDF/D265T050.pdf

(![Recommended Tension](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db23475d-1481-46ca-8ccd-a2cee577a575)

and

"Gates, the creator of the GT2 belt, recommends a tension of 6 to 8 pounds of tension when using a 6mm GT2 belt for registration like in a printer. A NEMA 17 stepper motor can handle 6.7 pounds (30N) of radial force centered at 17mm from the motor's face"
