# New V2 being tested!!!
# Direct-Reading-GT2-Belt-Tension-Gauge
A method to accurately determine GT2 belt tension

![Math Formula](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46931420-2bd3-4c01-8f57-04409e5adf24)

Per the 1/64 deflection per inch of belt method

I created three STL's, Forward Pins, Sled, and Handle. These mount a Force Gauge

To set the amount of belt deflection, I am using a #10-32 socket head cap screw as a stop

Each 1/2 turn of a #10-32 screw equals 1/64 of an inch.

The first assembly was not accurate, it was determined that the friction of the belt against the pins was creating bad reading.

The second assemble used GT2 pulleys for the pins. The results have been within 0.2 pounds.

# Thanks to DIYshift, who's tension gauge was used to model the Front stl.
