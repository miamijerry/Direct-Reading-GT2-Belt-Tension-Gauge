1) Turn the deflection knob counter clockwise until it hits the stops.

2) Assemble the "Direct Reading GT2 Belt Tension Gauge on the center of the belt span

3) Set the Force Gauge to read pounds, slowly turn the Deflection Knob clockwise until the Force Gauge reads appoximately 0.10 pounds

4) Determine the length of the belt span in inches, divide these inches by 2 to get number of turns (IE 17 inch span would equal 8.5 turns) 

5) Rotate the Deflection Knob clockwise the number of turns determined in step 4

Read your belt tension on the Force Gauge in whatever unit you want. (IE pounds, Newtons, etc)
