# Tool is only for comparing magnets, will show relative weaker or stronger magnets then the magnet used to set the pointer.

Parts needed to assemble this tool.

Mount the Belt Tension Meter to the printed Backplate with longer screws M3x18mm work fine. (Note the M6x10 stainless grub screw threaded into the YeasterdaysCoffer meter, this grub screw should be nylon and more like M6x14mm long)

Advance the thread magnet carrier until the pointer reads 3.0 (This is relative, only good for comparating)

At this point the threaded carrier needs to be set to this depth with a jam nut.
