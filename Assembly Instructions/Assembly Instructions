Verify that the front and sled dovetails slide together with low force

1) The Front stl needs 2ea M3 X 8mm Tall heat inserts install where the pins (Idler Pulleys) mount.
2) Install 10-32 x 3/8 heat insert into the Front stl hole that runs thru the center of dovetail.
3) Install the two Idler pulley to the Front by ; 2ea 3.1 x 5 x 10mm spacers, 2ea M3 x 16mm screws, 2ea M3 x 9mm OD washers
4) Super glue 2ea M5 washer Aprox 14mm OD to the Sled stl where the 10-32 threaded rod passes thru. (See picture)
5) Deflection Knob stl assembly; 
a) Hold the threaded rod with vise grips about 15mm from one end
b) Run one 10-32 fiber locknut on the threaded rod, flush with one end
c) Install the thread rod so that the one installed nut can move into the hex cutout in the knob
d) Pull the rod out enough to hold again with the vise grip.
e) install another fiber locknut on the opposite end of the threaded rod.
f) Run the second locknut to about 10mm shy of clamping the Deflection Knob
g) Slide the thread rod, so that the first nut comes out of the hex cutout
h) Apply Super Glue to the first locknut and the threads near the locknut
i) Run the second locknut down, clamping the Deflection Knob
j) Now we have a Deflection Knob Threaded Screw, cut this to a exposed thread length of ???
6) Install the Deflection Knob Threaded Screw into the hole in the Sled, secure with a third locknut. tighten so the knob can still turn
7) Mount the Sled stl to the Force Gauge with 2ea M4 x 6mm flat head countersunk screws at the knob end.
8) Slide the Front stl onto the dovetail of the Sled, while rotating the Deflection Knob. run the knob down drawing the Front back
9) Install 2ea M4 x 12mm socket head screw and 2ea M% x 5mm spacer in the remaining two holes attaching the Sled to the Force Gauge (these are intended to act as stops)
10) Install the chisel tip on the Force Gauge with a dab of locktite. (See pictures when posted)
